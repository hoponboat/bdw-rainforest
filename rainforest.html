    <h1>The Pacific Temperate Rainforest</h1>
    <p>The temperate rainforest ecosystem of the Pacific coast of North America extends from northern California to Alaska’s Kodiak Island, and is characterized by high rainfall, extensive canopy coverage, some of the world’s largest trees, and high concentrations of ferns, mosses, lichens, and fungi.</p>

    <p>The diversity of life in these ecosystems is truly astounding; thousands of species live together, many of which form highly symbiotic relationships. But it is in the cooperation of these diverse species that reveals the delicate balance of nature, and the real majesty and beauty of the temperate rainforest.</p>
  <section id="Preciptation">
    <h2>Precipitation</h2>
    <p>Temperate rainforests may receive from 12 to 14 feet of precipitation per year. Such high amounts of precipitation are due to the close proximity of the Pacific Coast Ranges. As humid air moves east from over the Pacific ocean, it is forced to high altitude by these mountains where it cools and water vapor condenses in the form of rain or fog. The western slopes thus receive the majority of precipitation, leaving the eastern slopes and inland areas much more dry.</p>

    <h2>Watersheds</h2>

    <p>Rivers and streams are a keystone in the balancing structure of the rainforest ecosystem. They provide a steady source of water for all life and a home to aquatic plant and animal life.</p>
    <p>One phenomenon that seems crucial to the health of the inland rainforest is the yearly salmon run.Rivers of the pacific temperate rainforests provide spawning grounds for several species of salmon. For years it was believed that dead salmon were simply swept back to the ocean. But only recently did modern science discover salmon’s deeper connection to the greater rainforest ecosystem.</p>
    <p>After years of in depth study it was found that as salmon swim upstream, they swim to the highest headwaters, including very small creeks and streams. Here they spawn and then die, leaving the flesh of their bodies many miles inland. Their carcasses are then broken down and brought further inland by scavenger animals such as raccoon, bear, or eagles. Their bones are even broken down by various processes including digestion by slugs.</p>

            </ul>
      </aside>
    <p>Modern science has determined that salmon actually bring many vital nutrients inland from the ocean including nitrogen and calcium. Some biologists posit that without salmon, there would not be enough calcium in the land for elk to grow their horns.</p>

    <h2>Trees</h2>

    <p>The temperate rainforest is dominated by dense growth of conifers, and marked by patches of specific deciduous trees. Differing species have different requirements for growth, and it is fascinating to see how nature has developed ways of meeting these requirements.</p>
    <p class= "caption secondary">Many plant species including conifers, require much more organically available nitrogen whichis not readily available in the rocky terrain at the foothills of the pacific range mountains. Biologists have found that Red Alder is one of the first species to populate disturbedland, such as in the wake of land slides or floods. The roots of the Red Alder are home to bacteria that can fix raw nitrogen into the soil. As the alders grow and shed their leaves year after year, the raw rocky land becomes inhabitable by other species such as the Sword Fern and Big Leaf maple.</p>
        <aside> 
          <h3>Conifer Species</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>sitka spruce</li>
              <li>western hemlock</li>
              <li>douglas fir</li>
              <li>western red cedar</li>
            </ul>
    </aside>
    <p>Over time, the soil of the forest floor becomes richer by the accumulation of decaying leaves from Alder trees and other plants. Eventually conifers begin to populate the land and this is an earmark of “old growth” forests. As a rainforest ages and becomes more and more dense, the ground so thick with plant life, and the canopy so covered by foliage, it becomes virtually impossible for seedlings to take root and grow.</p>
    <p>Herein lies another phenomenon crucial to the balance of the rainforest ecosystem. As large conifer trees die, they fall, leveling everything in their path. Thus they open the canopy and create a “light gap” allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor. As the dead tree decays, it provides fertile ground for new seedlings and is called a “nurse log.”</p>

    <h2>Fungi</h2>
    <p>Fungi also play an incredibly important role in the balance of thisecosystem. Not only do fungi breakdown and recycle dead plant matter, they also directly provide living plants with water and nutrients.</p>
    <P>As tree seedlings sprout atop a nurse log, it is vital to their survival that their roots make contact with fungal mycelium. As mushrooms are the “flowers” of fungi, mycelium are the bodies. Mycelium are tiny thread like fibers, often only a single cell in width. They both digest dead matter, and help deliver water and nutrients to the roots of living trees. If it weren’t for mycelium growing in nurse logs, new seedlings would not have enough energy to grow a tap root long enough to reach water or extract nutrients necessary for its survival.</p>
    <p>Is this the largest organism in the world? This 2,400acre (9.7 km2) site in eastern Oregon had a contiguous growth of mycelium before logging roads cut through it. Estimated at 1,665 football fields in size and 2,200 years old, this one fungus has killed the forest above it several times over, and in so doing has built deeper soil layers that allow the growth of everlarger stands of trees. Mushroomforming forest fungi are unique in that their mycelial mats can achieve such massive proportions.»Paul Stamets, Mycelium Running</p>

    <h2>Epiphytes</h2>
    <p>Epiphytes are plants that grow upon another plant and derive moisture and nutrients from the air and debris that accumulates in or around it. These plants such as mosses and lichens, do not live parasitically—they do not derive nutrients from their host plant, but in fact often provide the host with more moisture and nutrients.</p>
    <p>An interesting modern discovery is that of trees sprouting roots from their limbs. Biologists studying the tree canopy discovered that as they peeled back old mats of moss, they revealed roots growing from the tree into the moss. Upon further study they found that the moss acts as a filter, catching not only moisture, but nutrients from atmospheric dust and the bodies of thousands of insect species.</p>
    <p>Thus the moss acts to bring moisture and nutrients higher up in the body of the tree. This may explain why trees in these ecosystems can grow to such dimensions, as bringing water and nutrients up hundreds of feet from the ground is much more difficult.</p>
